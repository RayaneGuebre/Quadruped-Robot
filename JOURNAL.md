## 10/25/2025 - Started designing the body and the lefs  

So far i've  managed to design the body and one of the legs, an i'm later going to add the rest of the legs 
The only issue i got so far is adding the joints to the design, but i think that if continue struggle i may just skip them
myplan for tomorrow is to add the other legs and try to improve their design, and if i've time i'm also going to start working on the electronics
