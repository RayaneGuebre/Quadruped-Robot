## 10/25/2025 - Started designing the body and the lefs  

So far i've  managed to design the body and one of the legs, an i'm later going to add the rest of the legs 
The only issue i got so far is adding the joints to the design, but i think that if continue struggle i may just skip them
myplan for tomorrow is to add the other legs and try to improve their design, and if i've time i'm also going to start working on the electronics

sooo, I'm very happy because I just finished the legs of the robot,
i'm managed to make the leg a little longer so that the robot will be a little more detached from the ground? The only downside it's that now I'll have to start working on the electronics and the code, not because it's going to take a long time but because the code is complex, my plan is to use a PS4 controller (I don't have enough time to design one)  and add an ESP camera. I'm also going to add some holes in the center so that I can upgrade it in the future.
